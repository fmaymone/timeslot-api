    #

    # through social relations and also handle different type of feeds:
    #
    # 1. User Feed (takes all "me activities" where actor is the current user)
    # 2. Public Feed (activities from friends, groups, reslots, followings),
    #    own activities are not included here as well as activities
    #    related to the current users content
    # 3. Notification Feed (takes all activities which are related to the users content),
    #    own activities are not included here
    #
